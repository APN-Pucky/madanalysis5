of one or more particles or objects. We list in the tables below all observables
supported by \MA, and begin with those that do not depend on the momenta of any
object. They are therefore called without any argument.\\

\noindent \MA\ can be used to double check the merging procedure of event samples related
to a given hard process but with matrix elements featuring a different
final-state jet multiplicity. \MA\ has to be started in the hadronic mode, and
the check is then performed by typing in
{\color{ao}\begin{verbatim}
 set main.merging.check = true
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent Two extra options are available,
{\color{ao}\begin{verbatim}
  set main.merging.ma5_mode = <true or false>
  set main.merging.njets = <integer>
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent the first one indicating to extract the number of extra hard jets from the
process identifier, and the second one setting up the maximum number of extra
jets to consider.
